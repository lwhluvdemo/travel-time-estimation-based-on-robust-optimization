# travel-time-estimation-based-on-robust-optimization
Undergraduate graduation design part of the code, using the New York taxi data OD data from kaggle, through the robust optimization model to solve the city travel time estimation problem.

When you hope that clone code can run the sample code successfully later, you'd better modify the data reading path first.

At present, the project only provides such a part of functions: the conversion method from $\left(x_O,y_O,x_D,y_D\right)$ data to $G\left(V,E\right)$ chart.

Other functions will be added after the overall improvement.

目前该项目仅提供这样的一部分功能：从$\left(x_O,y_O,x_D,y_D\right)$数据到$G\left(V,E\right)$图的转换方法。

其他功能将在整体完善后不断添加。
